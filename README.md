 Free Bingo Blitz credits and how to get them
The main method is very simple - because the developers of Bingo Blitz themselves have clarified there are no roundabout methods to get them. But, they regularly offer free credits as incentives on their social media, mainly pointing players to their Facebook page; although it may be worth checking in on their other platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) to see if they post any unique codes there too.
Bingo Blitz also offers free credits via their website, which refreshes on a semi-regular basis, and explains the other methods in the game, including friend codes (links you can send to friends that provide credits when redeemed) and completing mini-games or other game modes to receive credits as rewards.

One important thing to note is that Bingo Blitz warns against potential third-party scammers, so itâ€™s worth taking any sites claiming to offer free credits outside the normal methods with a pinch of salt. They say the safest (and probably simplest) way is to follow the official guidelines they outline on their website if you do want free credits for Bingo Blitz.
